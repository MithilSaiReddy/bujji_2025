# Day 2 (04-06-25)
## Time spent:- 3.5hrs
I think every day is not  exciting but i believe in consistency .so today after many designs i finalized one which is simple and works!
---
## Design :- 
![My imagination ](https://github.com/MithilSaiReddy/bujji_2025/blob/main/assets/basic.jpg)

### Hope the final case also looks like this ðŸ˜…

*AS this is my first hardware project i want to keep the design simple and good looking*

# Day 3(12-06-25)

### The Final price is under $75

### I think my side work is done now the hackclub team should review the project and hope they fund it to give life to bujji coming to the software part i think i can only work on it if i have the hardware with me because the system i am using is also far less capable .Hope everything goes right ðŸ˜Š.

 i thought of removing the screen as it makes the budget more and also i still don't have that much experience so instead going into project creep i just want  to make it simple for now if possible updating it in the future version*
